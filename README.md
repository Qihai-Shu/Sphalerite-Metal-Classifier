# Sphalerite-Metal-Classifier
The Sphalerite Metal Classifier is a classifier trained on multiple machine learning algorithms to predict the metal type of skarn deposits based on the trace element composition of sphalerite. This program facilitates deposit genesis identification on computers lacking a machine learning environment.
